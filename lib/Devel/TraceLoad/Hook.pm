=head1 SYNOPSIS

    register_require_hook( sub {
        my ( $when, $depth, $arg, $p, $f, $l, $rc, $err ) = @_;

C<require> (and C<use>) to be registered.

    # one hook will fail and that we'll be rethrowing that error here -
    # but we concatenate all the errors so that when multiple hooks fail
    # someone gets to see the diagnostic.

    die join( ', ', @errs ) if @errs;
}

=head2 C<< register_require_hook >>

Register a function to be called immediately before and after each
C<require> (and C<use>).

The registered function should look something like this:

    sub done_require {
        my ( $when, $depth, $arg, $p, $f, $l, $rc, $err ) = @_;
        # ... do stuff ...
    }
    
The arguments are as follows:

=over

=item C<$when>

The hook function is called both before and after the require is
executed. The first argument will contain either 'before' or 'after' as
appropriate.

=item C<$depth>

How deeply nested this require is.

=item C<$arg>

The argument to C<require>.

=item C<$p>, C<$f>, C<$l>

The package, file and line where the calling C<require> or C<use> is.

=item C<$rc>, C<$err>

When the hook function is called after a C<require> C<$rc> and
C<$err> will contain the return value of the require and any error
that it raised.

=back

You may throw an error (using C<die>) from the hook function. If an
error is thrown during 'before' processing the real call to C<require>
will not take place. In this way it is possible to simulate a module
being unavailable.

See L<Devel::TraceLoad> for a complete example of this interface.
